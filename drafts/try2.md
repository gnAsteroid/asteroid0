## Inspiration Behind the Innovation

Imagine a world where documents were isolated islands, inaccessible to one another. That was the reality before the dawn of the World Wide Web. Hyperlinks changed everything,
 connecting computer scientists, researchers, and students across the globe. Today, we see the evolution of personal and corporate web pages, still thriving as blogs.

## The Balance Between Dependence and Independence

GNO's success depends on finding the perfect equilibrium along the dependence/independence spectrum. This delicate balance is crucial for the platform's growth and adoption

Let's explore two extreme scenarios:

1. Everything on gno.land (on-chain):
   - Uniform design
   - Limited flexibility
   - Restricted collaboration with external documents
   - Potential stifling of creativity

2. dApps and SPAs connected to gno.land:
   - Complex development process
   - Lack of standardization
   - High barriers to entry
   - Missed opportunities for content creation

We're currently exploring the middle ground, where asteroids serve as catalysts for community formation. These platforms attract various groups:

- Enthusiasts
- Programmers
- Bloggers
- Influencers
- Teams

Just as blogs expanded the internet's editorial palette, asteroids can drive GNO's growth, catering to individual demands and preferences.
