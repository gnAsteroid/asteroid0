## inspiration

The World Wide Web really started connecting documents of computer scientists, researchers or students through hyperlinks. It created lines between islands previously sometimes too remote to be discerned. A bit later, personal webpages appeared, later becoming blogs and social media.

## dependence/independence 

If GNO is to succeed, its content (code excluded) needs to find its **balance** on the dependence/independence continuum. 

Here are 2 extremes of this continuum:

1. All the content is on gno.land (i.e. everything on-chain):
   * same colorscheme,
   * same header/footer,
   * inability to work with offchain documents,
   * => dampened creativity.
2. dApps, SPA (single-page application) with connection to gno.land:
   * lack of simplicity (lot of work),
   * lack of standards,
   * => high barrier of entry
   * => missed opportunity of content creation.

There remains in the beginning some unaddressed space in the middle. One particular point of balance can initially be asteroids, which may give shape to loose communities of:

* enthusiasts, 
* programmers, 
* bloggers, 
* influencers,
* (maybe) teams.

You may be indifferent to most blogs, yet a small number will appeal to you. Asteroids favorize the expansion of GNO in the same way personal websites and blogs did: having them expands the treatment of reality through different lens and points of view, such that people individual tastes meet one of the few content somewhere.
