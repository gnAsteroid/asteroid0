**Asteroids** gravitate around [gno.land](wiki/gnoland.md). 

They can be thought of as markdown wikis that are aware of GNO [realms](wiki/realm.md).

<!--Use them for scribbles, casual-blogging about crypto, notes, scratches, demo, etc.-->

<sup>1</sup>: you may be curious how<!--(how they can render realms)-->. <!--It's explained on this [page](usage.md) (look for "gnoface").--> Consider this snippet in Markdown: `[try tic-tac-toe](/r/demo/games/tictactoe)`; it renders as: [try tic-tac-toe](/r/demo/games/tictactoe) ‚Üê Clicking this will show that realm rendering *right* on this asteroid (even though it runs on the gno.land chain). 

## a word of caution

<img src=/svg/alien-4.svg hspace=5 align=left />When security matters always check things on gno.land. Even though you can not run wallet transactions on asteroids, you should never trust them with your life. The point of asteroids is to provide rich blogging and reading experience. As soon as you want to check or do something that matters, do it directly on https://gno.land.
